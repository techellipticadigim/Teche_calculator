Bug: Handling Multiple Numbers for Addition
Steps to reproduce: 1)Open the calculator application or device.
                    2)Enter multiple numbers intended for addition, for example: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
                    3)Perform the addition operation.
                    4)Verify the result displayed by the calculator for accuracy.


Bug: When we input the sequence 5+6+6+6+6+8+7, it should display the same number.
Steps to reproduce: 1)the issue where the input sequence "5+6+6+6+6+8+7" doesn't display the correct number:
                    2)Input the sequence "5+6+6+6+6+8+7" into the designated input field or calculator.
                    3)Observe the displayed result to verify if it matches the expected outcome.


Bug:  multiple operator should be not accepted by calculator
Steps to reproduce :1)Enter multiple operators consecutively into the calculator, such as "+", "-", "*", "/", etc.
                    2)Observe the calculator's response.
                    3)Verify that the calculator does not accept or process multiple operators in sequence and ideally displays an error message or ignores the input.
                     for example:
                     Inputting "5++3" should yield an expected result that does not accept the repeated "++" operator.

Bug: We can't delete single digit from more than one digit number.( it will delete all number)
Steps to reproduce:1)Enter a multi-digit number into the calculator.
                   2)Attempt to delete a single digit from the entered number.
                   3)Observe that instead of deleting the intended single digit, the entire number is cleared from the display.


Bug:When we enter negative and positive number then result is NAN
Steps to reproduce:1)Input a negative number and a positive number into the calculator, e.g., -5 and 3.
                   2)Perform the addition operation.
                   3)Verify that the result displayed is 'NaN' (Not a Number) instead of the expected sum, which should be 2.


Bug: When we enter numbers in loop then application size
Steps to reproduce:1)Continuously input numbers into the calculator in a loop.
                   2)Monitor the application size during this process.
                   3)Note any increase in the application size as numbers are entered repeatedly.


Bug: When multiple numbers are entered, the addition operation should display the sum of those numbers.
Steps to reproduce:1)Enter multiple numbers into the calculator.
                   2)Initiate the addition operation.
                   3)Verify that the result displayed on the calculator screen is the sum of the entered numbers.

Bug:Pressing 0 should only occur once, whereas in our application, pressing 0 may happen multiple times.
Steps to reproduce:1)When entering '0', ensure it is accepted only once and not multiple times.


Bug- two operator doesn't work not get accurate result.
Steps to reproduce: when we enter (-5)+(-6) application should display correct result
